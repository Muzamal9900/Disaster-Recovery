          Safe Work Method Statement Development:
          
          Step 1: Hazard Identification
          • Physical hazards (slips, trips, falls)
          • Chemical hazards (cleaning agents)
          • Biological hazards (mould, bacteria)
          • Ergonomic hazards (lifting, repetitive)
          • Psychosocial hazards (stress, fatigue)
          
          Step 2: Risk Matrix Assessment
          Likelihood × Consequence = Risk Level
          • Rare (1) × Insignificant (1) = Low (1)
          • Possible (3) × Moderate (3) = Medium (9)
          • Likely (4) × Major (4) = High (16)
          • Almost Certain (5) × Catastrophic (5) = Extreme (25)
          
          Step 3: Control Measures (Hierarchy)
          1. Elimination - Remove the hazard
          2. Substitution - Replace with safer option
          3. Engineering - Isolate the hazard
          4. Administrative - Procedures & training
          5. PPE - Last line of defence
          
          Documentation Requirements:
          • Date and version control
          • All workers must sign SWMS
          • Review after incidents
          • Update when tasks change
