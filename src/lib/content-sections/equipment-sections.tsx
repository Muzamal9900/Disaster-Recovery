            Understanding how professional {equipmentName.toLowerCase()} equipment works helps you
            appreciate why it is essential for quality restoration outcomes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Detection capability</strong> — Professional-grade {equipmentName.toLowerCase()} identifies damage, moisture, or contamination that visual inspection alone would miss.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision measurement</strong> — Quantitative readings allow technicians to track restoration progress objectively, ensuring drying and treatment targets are met before sign-off.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation</strong> — Equipment readings provide verifiable evidence for insurance claims, compliance records, and quality assurance documentation.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency</strong> — Targeted application of restoration resources based on equipment data reduces overall project time and cost.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our technicians calibrate and verify equipment before every job, following manufacturer
