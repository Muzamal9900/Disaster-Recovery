        </p>
        <h3>Water Contamination Categories</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Category 1 (Clean Water)</strong> — Originates from a sanitary source such as a broken
            supply line or leaking tap. Bacterial count below 1 CFU/mL. Safe for occupants if addressed
            within 24–48 hours before microbial amplification occurs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Category 2 (Grey Water)</strong> — Contains significant contamination from sources like
            dishwasher overflow, washing machine discharge, or aquarium leaks. Bacterial count below
            10⁴ CFU/mL. Requires antimicrobial treatment and PPE during restoration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Category 3 (Black Water)</strong> — Grossly contaminated water from sewage, rising
            floodwater, or prolonged Category 1–2 exposure. Bacterial count exceeds 10⁴ CFU/mL. Demands
            full containment, removal of all affected porous materials, and professional-grade
            decontamination.

          and health risk. Category 1 water left untreated for 48+ hours degrades to Category 2 or 3.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Drying Classes (Material Saturation)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Class 1</strong> — Least amount of water. Affects only part of a room with low-porosity materials.</li>
          <li><strong>Class 2</strong> — Significant water. Wicks up walls to 600mm. Affects carpet and underlay.</li>
          <li><strong>Class 3</strong> — Greatest amount of water. Saturates walls, ceilings, insulation, and subfloor.</li>
          <li><strong>Class 4</strong> — Specialty drying. Deep-seated moisture in hardwood, plaster, concrete, or stone requiring low-humidity drying.</li>

          damage — meaning you must take reasonable steps to stop ongoing water ingress and begin drying
          as soon as possible. Failure to mitigate can reduce your claim payout.
        </p>
        <h3>Australian Consumer Law</h3>
        <p>
          Restoration contractors must provide services with due care and skill under the Australian
          Consumer Law. Work must be fit for purpose and completed within a reasonable timeframe.
          You have the right to a remedy if work is substandard.
        </p>

          Your insurance policy requires you to take &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to prevent further damage.
          This includes turning off water at the mains, removing furniture from affected areas, and
          contacting a professional restorer immediately. Document everything with photos and timestamps
          for your claim.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>AFCA Complaints Process</h3>
        <p>
          If your insurer disputes your water damage claim, you can lodge a complaint with the
          Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA). AFCA provides free, independent dispute
          resolution for consumers and covers claims up to $1,085,000 for general insurance.

DIY drying without moisture monitoring frequently leads to hidden mould growth within 2–8 weeks.' },
      { question: 'What happens if water damage is left untreated?', answer: 'Untreated water damage leads to mould growth within 24–48 hours, structural timber rot within weeks, electrical hazards from water ingress into wiring, and potential health issues from microbial contamination. Restoration costs increase by 40–60% for every 24 hours of delay. Category 1 water degrades to Category 2 or 3 over time.' },
      { question: 'How much does water damage restoration cost in Australia?', answer: 'Costs vary by damage category, class, and scope. A small Category 1 job (single room, hard floor) typically costs $2,000–$5,000. A moderate Category 2 job affecting multiple rooms costs $5,000–$15,000. Large Category 3 events with structural drying can exceed $30,000. Insurance covers most accidental damage events.' },

          contains the contamination, and verifies successful treatment.
        </p>
        <h3>The Remediation Process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Assessment</strong> — Qualified assessors identify mould species, contamination extent, and moisture source using air sampling, surface sampling, and moisture mapping.</li>
          <li><strong>Containment</strong> — Affected areas are sealed with polyethylene sheeting and negative air pressure (≥0.03 Pa) to prevent cross-contamination to unaffected areas.</li>
          <li><strong>HEPA Filtration</strong> — Air scrubbers with HEPA filters (99.97% efficiency at 0.3μm) run continuously to capture airborne spores during remediation.</li>
          <li><strong>Removal</strong> — All porous materials with mould penetration (drywall, carpet, insulation) are removed and disposed of as contaminated waste.</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment</strong> — Non-porous and semi-porous surfaces are treated with registered antimicrobial agents and physically cleaned.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification</strong> — Post-remediation air testing confirms spore counts return to normal background levels before containment is removed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip title="Why DIY Mould Removal Fails">
          Spraying bleach on visible mould only kills surface growth — it does not address root
          systems (hyphae) penetrating porous materials or airborne spores throughout the property.
          Without containment, disturbing mould colonies spreads millions of spores into the air,
          potentially contaminating previously clean areas.

        <h3>Landlord and Tenant Obligations</h3>
        <p>
          Under Australian residential tenancy legislation, landlords must maintain rental properties
          in a reasonable state of repair, including addressing mould caused by structural defects or
          inadequate ventilation. Tenants must maintain reasonable ventilation and report mould promptly.
          Failure by either party can result in tribunal orders for remediation or compensation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Commercial property owners and employers have duties under WHS legislation to maintain
          safe workplaces free from biological hazards including mould. Employees exposed to
          mould may be entitled to workers compensation claims.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Strata and Body Corporate">
          In strata properties, responsibility for mould remediation depends on whether the moisture
          source is within the lot (owner responsibility) or common property (body corporate
          responsibility). The Strata Schemes Management Act 2015 (NSW) and equivalent legislation
          in other states governs this distinction.

          </CitationTooltip>{' '}
          provides the framework for professional restoration.
        </p>
        <h3>The Four Restoration Phases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Phase 1: Safety Assessment</strong> — Structural engineers assess load-bearing integrity. Hazmat teams test for asbestos (common in pre-1990 Australian buildings), lead paint, and chemical contamination. Utilities are isolated.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 2: Debris and Contents Removal</strong> — Damaged materials are categorised as salvageable or non-salvageable. Contents are inventoried for insurance purposes. Hazardous waste is disposed of per EPA regulations.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 3: Smoke and Soot Remediation</strong> — Different fire types produce different residues: protein fires (kitchen) leave invisible, pungent films; synthetic fires produce thick, sticky soot. HEPA vacuuming, dry sponging, wet cleaning, and thermal fogging address each residue type.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase 4: Structural Repair</strong> — Ranges from minor plasterboard replacement to full structural rebuild. Must comply with current National Construction Code (NCC) standards, which may exceed the original construction standard.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip title="Smoke Particle Science">
          Smoke particles range from 0.01 to 4 microns — far smaller than the 10-micron particles
          visible to the naked eye. These PM2.5 particles penetrate deep into porous materials including
          concrete, timber framing, and soft furnishings. Standard household cleaning cannot remove
          embedded smoke particles, which continue off-gassing toxic VOCs for months.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Types of Fire Residue</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dry smoke</strong> — Fast-burning, high-temperature fires. Powdery, easier to clean.</li>
          <li><strong>Wet smoke</strong> — Low-temperature, smouldering fires. Sticky, pungent residue that smears during cleaning.</li>
          <li><strong>Protein residue</strong> — Kitchen fires. Nearly invisible but extremely odorous. Discolours paints and finishes over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Fuel oil soot</strong> — Furnace malfunctions. Dense, black, sticky residue requiring specialised solvents.</li>

    legalSections: (
      <>
        <h3>Asbestos Obligations</h3>
        <p>
          Properties built before 1990 in Australia may contain asbestos-containing materials (ACMs).
          Fire damage can expose, disturb, or release asbestos fibres. Under WHS Regulations,
          any asbestos removal must be performed by a licensed asbestos removalist. Penalties for
          unlicensed removal exceed $50,000 for individuals and $250,000 for corporations.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Building Compliance">
          Fire-damaged structures repaired under insurance must comply with the current National
          Construction Code (NCC), not the code applicable when the building was originally constructed.
          This can significantly affect repair scope and cost — ensure your insurance assessor
          accounts for code upgrade requirements.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Insurance Claims for Fire Damage</h3>
        <p>
          Fire damage is typically covered under Australian home and contents insurance, including the
          building, contents, temporary accommodation, and demolition/rebuild costs. Arson by the
          policyholder voids coverage. You must not dispose of damaged items until the insurer has
          inspected or authorised disposal.
        </p>
        <h3>EPA Waste Disposal</h3>
        <p>
          Fire debris containing hazardous materials (asbestos, chemicals, electronics) must be
          disposed of at licensed facilities per state EPA regulations. Illegal dumping carries
          penalties up to $1 million for corporations.

          Understanding the insurance claims process is critical for disaster recovery outcomes. The
          process follows a structured timeline with legal obligations on both parties.
        </p>
        <h3>The Claims Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Immediate (0–24 hours)</strong> — Mitigate further damage (e.g., turn off water, tarp roof). Contact insurer to lodge claim. Begin photographic documentation of all damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Assessment (1–10 days)</strong> — Insurer acknowledges claim. Loss assessor or insurance assessor inspects property. Scope of loss is documented.</li>
          <li><strong>Decision (10 days – 4 months)</strong> — Insurer determines coverage, appoints restoration contractor or approves policyholder-nominated contractor. Cash settlement or managed repair offered.</li>
          <li><strong>Restoration (variable)</strong> — Approved works proceed. Progress inspections by insurer-appointed assessors. Completion sign-off and policy excess payment.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip title="Document Everything">
          Take timestamped photos and video of all damage before any cleanup begins. Keep receipts for
          all emergency expenses (accommodation, food, temporary repairs). Maintain a written log of
          all communications with your insurer, including dates, names, and reference numbers.
          This documentation is critical if a dispute arises.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Key Insurance Terminology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sum insured</strong> — The maximum amount your insurer will pay for a claim.</li>
          <li><strong>Excess</strong> — The amount you pay towards each claim (typically $500–$1,000).</li>
          <li><strong>PDS (Product Disclosure Statement)</strong> — The legal document outlining what is and is not covered.</li>
          <li><strong>Duty to mitigate</strong> — Your legal obligation to prevent further damage after an event.</li>
          <li><strong>Cash settlement</strong> — Payment of estimated repair costs directly to you, rather than managed repair.</li>

        <h3>Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth)</h3>
        <p>
          This federal legislation sets the framework for all insurance contracts in Australia. Key
          provisions include the duty of utmost good faith (both parties), insurer obligations to
          handle claims efficiently and fairly, and policyholder rights to dispute decisions.
        </p>
        <h3>General Insurance Code of Practice 2020</h3>
        <p>
          The industry code requires insurers to: acknowledge claims within 10 business days, keep you
          informed of claim progress, make a decision within 4 months (or explain delays), and provide
          written reasons for any denial.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Your Rights Under AFCA">
          If your insurer denies your claim, delays beyond reasonable timeframes, or offers an
          inadequate settlement, you can lodge a free complaint with the Australian Financial
          Complaints Authority (AFCA). AFCA can award compensation up to $1,085,000 for general
          insurance disputes. There is no cost to the consumer.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Common Exclusions</h3>
        <p>
          Standard Australian insurance policies typically exclude: gradual damage from maintenance
          neglect, pre-existing damage, wear and tear, intentional damage by the policyholder,
          damage during renovations without insurer notification, and specific flood exclusions
          in some policies.

        <h3>The PPRR Framework</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prevention</strong> — Measures to eliminate or reduce the impact of disasters. Includes building maintenance, water leak detection systems, fire suppression, and structural reinforcement.</li>
          <li><strong>Preparedness</strong> — Plans and arrangements to ensure effective response. Emergency contact lists, insurance review, contents inventory, and household emergency kits.</li>
          <li><strong>Response</strong> — Actions taken immediately before, during, and after a disaster. Life safety first, property preservation second. Containment, extraction, and stabilisation.</li>
          <li><strong>Recovery</strong> — Restoration of the affected community and environment. Cleanup, repair, rebuild, and support services for affected people.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip title="The Golden Hour in Restoration">
          Just as emergency medicine has the &quot;golden hour&quot; for trauma, disaster restoration has a
          critical first-response window. Water extraction within 60 minutes reduces drying time by
          up to 40%. Smoke residue removed within 24 hours prevents permanent staining. Fire damage
          stabilised within 48 hours prevents secondary water damage from firefighting efforts.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Professional Emergency Response Sequence</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dispatch (0–15 minutes)</strong> — Emergency call received, nearest qualified team dispatched, ETA confirmed.</li>
          <li><strong>Arrival and Assessment (15–60 minutes)</strong> — Site safety check, hazard identification, initial damage assessment, containment plan developed.</li>
          <li><strong>Containment (1–4 hours)</strong> — Water extraction begins, temporary board-up/tarp-up, electrical isolation, access restriction for unsafe areas.</li>
          <li><strong>Stabilisation (4–24 hours)</strong> — Drying equipment deployed, air quality monitoring commenced, detailed scope of loss documented, insurer notified.</li>
          <li><strong>Recovery Planning (24–72 hours)</strong> — Full restoration plan developed, timeline and cost estimate prepared, approved works scheduled.</li>

        <h3>Work Health and Safety Obligations</h3>
        <p>
          Emergency response in disaster recovery carries significant WHS obligations under the Work
          Health and Safety Act 2011. Restorers must conduct risk assessments before entering damaged
          properties, use appropriate PPE (respiratory protection, protective clothing, eye protection),
          and follow Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS) for high-risk construction work.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Your Safety as a Property Owner">
          Do not re-enter a fire-damaged, flood-affected, or structurally compromised property until
          it has been assessed by a qualified professional. Electrical hazards, structural collapse,
          contaminated water, and toxic fumes pose immediate life-threatening risks. Emergency services
          may issue access restrictions that carry legal force.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Emergency Management Legislation</h3>
        <p>
          Each Australian state has emergency management legislation (e.g., State Emergency and Rescue
          Management Act 1989 in NSW) that empowers SES, fire services, and police to restrict access,
          order evacuations, and coordinate disaster response. Private restoration contractors must
          coordinate with these authorities.

          Psychrometrics is the scientific foundation of all professional structural drying. It is
          the discipline that separates qualified restorers from unqualified ones — and the reason
          why professional drying succeeds where DIY attempts fail.
        </p>
        <h3>Core Psychrometric Concepts</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Relative Humidity (RH)</strong> — The percentage of water vapour in air relative to the maximum it can hold at that temperature. RH = (Actual vapour pressure / Saturation vapour pressure) × 100%. Target indoor RH: 30–50%.</li>
          <li><strong>Dew Point</strong> — The temperature at which air becomes saturated and condensation occurs. Td ≈ T − ((100 − RH) / 5). Condensation on building surfaces causes secondary water damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Grains Per Pound (GPP)</strong> — The absolute measure of moisture in air. One pound of air can hold varying amounts of water vapour depending on temperature. GPP is temperature-independent, making it the professional&apos;s preferred metric.</li>
          <li><strong>Grain Depression</strong> — The difference between ambient GPP and the dehumidifier&apos;s outlet GPP. Higher grain depression = faster drying.</li>
          <li><strong>Specific Humidity</strong> — Mass of water vapour per unit mass of dry air. Used in engineering calculations for HVAC and drying system design.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip title="Why Temperature Matters for Drying">
          Warmer air holds more moisture (higher saturation capacity). Raising the temperature in a
          drying chamber from 20°C to 30°C nearly doubles the air&apos;s moisture-carrying capacity.
          Professional restorers use this principle by combining heated air movers with
          dehumidification to dramatically accelerate drying rates.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>The Drying Equation</h3>
        <p>
          Evaporation Rate = (Vapour Pressure Differential × Air Flow) / Material Resistance
        </p>
        <p>
          This equation drives every decision in professional structural drying. To maximise
          evaporation, restorers optimise three variables:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vapour pressure differential</strong> — Increased by dehumidification (lowering air RH below material RH)</li>
          <li><strong>Air flow</strong> — Increased by air movers positioned to create laminar flow across wet surfaces</li>
          <li><strong>Material resistance</strong> — Varies by material type. Hardwood resists moisture release more than carpet</li>
        </ul>
      </>

    legalSections: (
      <>
        <h3>Documentation Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Insurance companies increasingly require psychrometric documentation to support drying
          claims. Daily moisture readings, psychrometric calculations, and equipment logs demonstrate
          that professional standards were followed. Without this documentation, insurers may dispute
          the duration and cost of drying operations.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Industry Standard of Care">
          The IICRC S500 standard establishes the industry standard of care for structural drying.
          Restorers who fail to follow psychrometric drying principles may be liable for
          consequential damage (e.g., mould growth from inadequate drying). This standard is
          referenced in insurance disputes and legal proceedings.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Building Standards Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          The National Construction Code (NCC) and Australian Standards (AS 1684 for timber framing)
          specify acceptable moisture content for building materials. Timber framing must be dried to
          8–12% moisture content before any enclosure work (plastering, painting). Failing to meet
          these thresholds before closing walls creates conditions for timber rot and mould.

      { question: 'Why does structural drying take so long?', answer: 'Structural drying time depends on the drying class, material types, and environmental conditions. Concrete and hardwood release moisture much slower than carpet or drywall. The drying process must be controlled to prevent cracking, warping, and secondary damage. Rushing drying with excessive heat can damage materials. Typical structural drying takes 3–7 days for standard materials.' },
      { question: 'What equipment is used for professional drying?', answer: 'Professional drying uses: Low Grain Refrigerant (LGR) dehumidifiers for most conditions, desiccant dehumidifiers for low-temperature or specialty drying, centrifugal air movers for surface evaporation, axial fans for large-area air circulation, and thermal hygrometers and moisture meters for daily monitoring.' },
      { question: 'What is the ideal humidity for drying a building?', answer: 'The target relative humidity for effective structural drying is typically 30–40%, which creates sufficient vapour pressure differential to drive moisture from wet materials into the air. The IICRC recommends maintaining at least 4.5 mmHg vapour pressure differential across wet surfaces. Conditions vary by climate zone — tropical Queensland requires different parameters than temperate Melbourne.' },
      { question: 'How do you know when a building is fully dry?', answer: 'A building is considered dry when moisture meter readings in all affected materials return to normal equilibrium moisture content (EMC). For timber, this is 8–12% in most Australian climates. Multiple measurement points are checked with both pin-type and pinless meters. Drying is documented with final moisture maps confirming all areas meet standard.' },

          Biohazard and trauma cleaning is the most regulated area of disaster restoration, involving
          biological hazards that pose direct health risks to technicians and occupants.
        </p>
        <h3>Biohazard Classification</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Level 1 (Low risk)</strong> — Small blood spills, single-room bodily fluid cleanup. Standard PPE and hospital-grade disinfectant.</li>
          <li><strong>Level 2 (Moderate risk)</strong> — Decomposition (early stage), drug lab residue, sewage overflow affecting multiple rooms. Enhanced PPE, HEPA filtration, and antimicrobial treatment.</li>
          <li><strong>Level 3 (High risk)</strong> — Advanced decomposition, large-scale trauma scenes, methamphetamine labs, infectious disease contamination. Full containment, respiratory protection, and decontamination showers.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip variant="warning" title="Never Attempt Biohazard Cleanup Yourself">
          Bloodborne pathogens including Hepatitis B (survives on surfaces for up to 7 days),
          Hepatitis C, and HIV require specific decontamination protocols. Household cleaning products
          cannot achieve the required log reduction (99.99% kill rate) for these pathogens.
          Improper cleanup risks infection and does not meet legal disposal requirements.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Decontamination Process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scene assessment</strong> — Hazard identification, PPE selection, SWMS development.</li>
          <li><strong>Gross removal</strong> — Physical removal of contaminated materials using biohazard containers.</li>
          <li><strong>Chemical treatment</strong> — Application of hospital-grade disinfectant with demonstrated efficacy against bloodborne pathogens (TGA-registered).</li>
          <li><strong>Structural treatment</strong> — Porous materials that absorbed biological matter are removed. Non-porous surfaces are chemically treated and verified.</li>
          <li><strong>Verification</strong> — ATP (adenosine triphosphate) testing confirms surfaces meet decontamination standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Waste disposal</strong> — All biohazard waste is packaged in yellow clinical waste bags and disposed of via licensed clinical waste contractor.</li>

        <h3>WHS Regulations for Biohazard Work</h3>
        <p>
          Under the Work Health and Safety Regulations, biohazard cleanup is classified as high-risk
          work requiring specific controls including risk assessment, Safe Work Method Statements,
          PPE including respiratory protection, and health monitoring for workers.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Clinical Waste Disposal">
          AS/NZS 3816 governs the management of clinical and related waste. Biohazard materials must
          be contained in yellow clinical waste bags, transported by licensed carriers, and disposed
          of at approved facilities. Failure to comply carries penalties under state environmental
          and health legislation.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Privacy and Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>
          Trauma and crime scene cleaning often involves sensitive personal circumstances. Professional
          cleaners maintain strict confidentiality regarding the nature and details of the scene.
          Police clearance certificates are mandatory for all technicians working in these environments.
        </p>
        <h3>Meth Lab Decontamination Standards</h3>
        <p>
          Clandestine drug laboratory cleanup in Australia must meet state-specific remediation
          standards (e.g., NSW Clandestine Drug Laboratory Guidelines). Properties must be tested
          before and after remediation, with surface contamination reduced below 0.5 μg/100cm² for
          methamphetamine. Clearance certificates are required before re-occupation.

          Australia is one of the most storm- and flood-affected nations in the developed world.
          Recovery from these events requires understanding both the immediate extraction needs and
          the long-term contamination risks.
        </p>
        <h3>Floodwater Classification</h3>
        <p>
          All floodwater is classified as Category 3 (black water) under IICRC S500, regardless of its
          visual appearance. Floodwater collects contaminants from sewage systems, agricultural runoff,
          industrial sites, and decaying organic matter. This means every flood event requires full
          contamination protocols.
        </p>
        <h3>Storm Damage Categories</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wind damage</strong> — Roof lifting, window breakage, structural damage, fallen trees. Requires immediate tarp-up and board-up to prevent secondary water ingress.</li>
          <li><strong>Hail damage</strong> — Roof denting/perforation, vehicle damage, external cladding damage. Perforated roofing allows water ingress during subsequent rain events.</li>
          <li><strong>Water ingress</strong> — Storm-driven rain entering through compromised roof, windows, or walls. Category 1 initially but can degrade if not addressed within 48 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Flash flooding</strong> — Rapid water rise from intense rainfall. Category 3 contamination. Often affects lower levels, basements, and ground-floor properties.</li>
          <li><strong>Riverine flooding</strong> — Prolonged inundation from river system overflow. Extended exposure causes greater structural damage and contamination.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip title="After the Flood Recedes">
          Floodwater leaves behind contaminated silt, mud, and debris that continue to harbour
          bacteria and pathogens. Do not assume the property is safe once water recedes. All
          flood-affected areas require professional decontamination. Remove waterlogged contents
          promptly — furniture left in contact with flood silt becomes a contamination source.

        <h3>Flood Insurance in Australia</h3>
        <p>
          Since 2012, Australian insurers have been required to use a standard definition of
          &quot;flood&quot; in their policies. However, coverage varies significantly between policies.
          Some policies exclude riverine flood while covering storm surge and rainwater runoff.
          Always check your PDS for the specific flood definition and any sub-limits that apply.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Flood vs Storm Damage">
          Insurance policies distinguish between &quot;storm damage&quot; (covered by almost all policies)
          and &quot;flood damage&quot; (which may have separate coverage, higher excess, or exclusion).
          Understanding this distinction is critical for your claim. If water enters through a
          storm-damaged roof, it is storm damage. If water rises from ground level due to
          overflowing waterways, it is flood damage.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Government Disaster Recovery Assistance</h3>
        <p>
          Following declared natural disasters, the Australian and state governments provide disaster
          recovery assistance including emergency payments, essential household goods grants, and
          structural assistance grants. These are means-tested and do not replace insurance coverage.
          Apply through your state emergency management agency.

          While the core restoration science is the same, commercial and residential projects differ
          significantly in execution requirements, regulatory compliance, and project management.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Differences</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scale</strong> — Commercial projects can affect multiple floors, thousands of square metres, and dozens of tenants simultaneously. Equipment and staffing requirements are correspondingly larger.</li>
          <li><strong>Business continuity</strong> — Every day a commercial property is offline costs revenue. Restoration must minimise downtime through staging, after-hours work, and parallel workflows.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance</strong> — Commercial buildings must meet BCA Class 5–9 requirements for fire rating, ventilation (AS/NZS 1668.2), accessibility, and essential services. All repairs must maintain or upgrade these standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Stakeholders</strong> — Commercial restoration involves building owners, property managers, multiple tenants, insurers, building certifiers, councils, and potentially health authorities.</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation</strong> — Commercial claims require detailed project management documentation including daily progress reports, cost tracking, variation management, and compliance certificates.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip title="Business Continuity Planning">
          The best time to plan for disaster recovery is before a disaster occurs. ISO 22301
          provides a framework for business continuity management that includes identifying critical
          business functions, establishing recovery time objectives, and maintaining relationships
          with qualified restoration contractors for rapid mobilisation.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Commercial-Specific Considerations</h3>

          <li><strong>Data and IT recovery</strong> — Server rooms, networking equipment, and digital records require specialist recovery services alongside physical restoration.</li>
          <li><strong>Regulatory compliance</strong> — Healthcare facilities (AS/NZS 3003), food premises (Food Standards Code), and childcare centres have sector-specific requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Heritage buildings</strong> — Heritage-listed commercial buildings require specialist restoration that preserves original materials and features.</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-tenancy coordination</strong> — Access scheduling, noise management, and containment must consider all building occupants.</li>
        </ul>
      </>

      <>
        <h3>Building Code of Australia Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          Commercial restorations must comply with the current BCA (National Construction Code Volume 1).
          Repairs to fire-rated walls, ceilings, and doors must restore the original fire rating
          with materials and methods that meet current standards — not just original construction
          standards.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Tenant and Landlord Obligations">
          Under commercial lease agreements, the allocation of restoration responsibilities between
          landlord and tenant depends on the lease terms. Generally, structural damage is the
          landlord&apos;s responsibility, while tenant fit-out damage falls to the tenant. Business
          interruption insurance and loss of rent cover should be reviewed alongside property insurance.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Essential Services Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          Commercial buildings must maintain essential safety measures (fire detection, sprinklers,
          emergency lighting, exit signage) at all times, including during restoration. Annual
          essential services statements must be maintained. Restoration work must not compromise
          these systems.

        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Standard of Care in Legal Proceedings">
          IICRC standards are frequently cited in Australian legal proceedings as the benchmark
          for professional restoration work. If restoration work does not meet IICRC standards
          and subsequent damage occurs (e.g., mould growth from inadequate drying), the contractor
          may be found negligent based on failure to meet the industry standard of care.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Consumer Protections</h3>
        <p>
          IICRC-certified firms commit to a code of ethics and complaint resolution process.
          If you are dissatisfied with work performed by an IICRC-certified firm, you can lodge
          a complaint through the IICRC&apos;s formal review process. This provides a recourse pathway
          beyond standard Australian Consumer Law protections.

          The Make Safe &amp; Forensic Assessment is a three-stage service designed to protect your
          property, your health, and your insurance claim from the moment our team arrives.
        </p>
        <h3>Stage 1: Forensic Engineering &amp; IICRC Inspection</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Source identification</strong> — Pinpointing the exact origin of damage using thermal imaging cameras, penetrating moisture meters, and visual inspection of concealed spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Moisture mapping</strong> — Creating a grid-based moisture map of all affected areas using pin-type and pinless meters, documenting baseline readings for the drying protocol.</li>
          <li><strong>Thermal imaging survey</strong> — FLIR thermal cameras identify hidden moisture behind walls, under floors, and in ceiling cavities that visual inspection cannot detect.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety audit</strong> — Assessment of electrical hazards, structural integrity, air quality, asbestos risk (pre-1990 buildings), and occupant safety clearance.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip title="Why Forensic Assessment Matters">
          Insurance assessors increasingly challenge claims that lack scientific documentation.
          A forensic assessment provides objective, measurable evidence that supports your claim
          scope — often recovering 30–50% more in claim value compared to undocumented submissions.
          The $2,750 investment typically pays for itself many times over in claim recovery.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Stage 2: Emergency Stabilisation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HEPA filtration</strong> — Air scrubbers with HEPA filters (99.97% at 0.3μm) deployed to capture airborne contaminants, mould spores, and particulate matter.</li>
          <li><strong>Dehumidifier deployment</strong> — Commercial-grade LGR dehumidifiers placed strategically based on psychrometric calculations to begin immediate moisture reduction.</li>
          <li><strong>Containment barriers</strong> — Polyethylene sheeting and negative air pressure systems isolate affected areas to prevent cross-contamination of unaffected spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Water extraction</strong> — Truck-mounted or portable extraction units remove standing water. Submersible pumps deployed for significant volumes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stage 3: Paperwork Assurance Report</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Scope of works</strong> — Detailed, line-item scope document that insurers can assess directly, eliminating back-and-forth disputes over what needs to be done.</li>
          <li><strong>Scientific justification</strong> — Every recommendation backed by IICRC standards, Australian Building Codes, and psychrometric data — making it virtually impossible for an assessor to reject on technical grounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost estimation</strong> — Market-rate pricing aligned with insurer expectations, prepared in formats compatible with major insurer claim systems (RestoreAssist.app).</li>
          <li><strong>Liability transfer</strong> — The report formally documents that reasonable mitigation steps have been taken under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 &quot;Duty of Utmost Good Faith&quot;, transferring ongoing liability risk from the property owner to the professional restoration process.</li>
        </ul>
        <ProTip>
          The Paperwork Assurance Report is your most powerful insurance document. It transforms
          your claim from &quot;I had water damage&quot; into &quot;Here is the scientific evidence of damage,
          the standards-based remediation protocol, and the documented cost to restore&quot;. Insurers
          process documented claims 60% faster than undocumented ones.

        <h3>Duty of Utmost Good Faith — Insurance Contracts Act 1984</h3>
        <p>
          Section 13 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) imposes a duty of utmost good faith
          on both the insurer and the insured. By engaging a professional Make Safe service, the
          property owner demonstrates compliance with their duty to mitigate further damage — a
          critical legal requirement that, if neglected, can reduce or void claim entitlements.
        </p>
        <ProTip variant="legal" title="Liability Transfer">
          The Paperwork Assurance Report creates a documented chain of professional responsibility.
          Once the report is delivered to the insurer, the property owner has formally discharged
          their duty to mitigate. Any further delay in restoration becomes the insurer&apos;s
          responsibility under the General Insurance Code of Practice 2020 timeline obligations.
        </ProTip>
        <h3>Consumer Protection</h3>
        <p>
          The $2,750 Make Safe fee is a fixed-price, all-inclusive service. Under the Australian
          Consumer Law, this constitutes a quoted price that cannot be increased without written
          agreement. The service includes all equipment, labour, materials, and the Paperwork
          Assurance Report — no hidden costs or surprise invoices.
        </p>
        <h3>Tax Deductibility</h3>
        <p>
          For investment properties and commercial premises, the Make Safe fee is generally
          tax-deductible as a repair and maintenance expense. Consult your accountant for
          specific advice regarding your circumstances.

    title: 'Insurance Payouts & Cash Settlements',
    snippetAnswer: (
      <>
        <p>
          An <strong>insurance cash settlement</strong> (payout) is when your insurer offers a lump sum instead of managing repairs directly. Cash settlements can work in your favour in specific situations — when contents loss exceeds the sum insured and you want to preserve your full contents claim, when you know the replacement costs and can organise repairs faster yourself, or when you do not want to replace the compromised item. However, payouts frequently work against property owners when hidden damage — water behind walls, mould in concealed cavities, smoke residue distributed through HVAC systems, sewage contamination wicked into sub-floor structures — turns out to be far more extensive than the initial assessment suggested. Roof damage, fire damage, water damage, mould, clandestine contamination, and crime scene damage are almost always under-assessed at first inspection. Once you accept a cash settlement, the claim is typically closed and additional costs become your responsibility. Before accepting any cash offer, get an independent assessment from an IICRC-certified restoration professional who can identify concealed damage through moisture mapping, thermal imaging, and invasive investigation that a general insurer assessor will not perform.
        </p>
      </>
    ),
    technicalSections: (
      <>
        <p>
          Insurance cash settlements in Australia are governed by the <em>Insurance Contracts Act 1984</em> (Cth) and the <em>General Insurance Code of Practice</em>. Understanding the mechanics, risks, and strategies is essential before accepting or rejecting any offer.
        </p>
        <h3>How Cash Settlement Offers Are Calculated</h3>
        <p>
          After you lodge a claim, the insurer sends an assessor (loss adjuster) to inspect the property. The assessor produces a scope of works based on visible damage and calculates a cost estimate using the insurer&apos;s pricing schedule. This estimate typically uses the lowest available labour rates, builder&apos;s-grade materials (not necessarily matching your existing finishes), and accounts only for damage visible at the time of inspection. The insurer then presents this figure as a cash-in-lieu offer — take the money and organise repairs yourself, or opt for the insurer&apos;s managed repair pathway.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The core problem:</strong> the offer is based on what the assessor can see during a non-invasive visual inspection. There is no moisture mapping, no thermal imaging, no invasive investigation behind wall linings or under floor coverings. For damage types where concealed damage is common — which includes nearly all water, fire, mould, sewage, and contamination events — this means the scope of works is almost certainly incomplete.
        </p>

        <h3>When Payouts Work in Your Favour</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contents loss exceeding the sum insured</strong> — Your policy has separate building and contents covers. If your contents damage is significant (furniture, electronics, clothing, personal items — a typical family home contains $80,000&ndash;$150,000 in contents), taking a cash payout for the building repair means the repair costs are <em>not subtracted from your contents claim</em>. This split strategy can maximise your total claim value by tens of thousands of dollars. Example: a kitchen fire with $30,000 building damage and $45,000 contents damage — taking a building payout preserves your full contents entitlement.</li>
          <li><strong>Known replacement costs with reliable quotes</strong> — If you have genuine quotes from qualified tradespeople, understand the full scope, and can manage the project yourself, a cash settlement bypasses the managed repair timeline (assessor visit, scope approval, panel builder allocation, builder scheduling — typically 6&ndash;12 weeks before work even begins).</li>
          <li><strong>Items you planned to replace or upgrade</strong> — If the damaged area was due for renovation, a payout gives flexibility to direct funds toward what you actually want rather than a like-for-like restoration of something you intended to change anyway.</li>
          <li><strong>Genuinely cosmetic or surface-level damage</strong> — A stain, a cracked tile, a damaged benchtop with no underlying moisture or structural concern. When damage is truly what-you-see-is-what-you-get, a payout for straightforward repair is practical.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When Payouts Work Against You — Hidden Damage by Type</h3>
        <p>
          Each type of property damage has characteristic patterns of concealed damage that insurer assessors routinely miss because they do not perform invasive investigation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Water damage</strong> — Water wicks into timber framing, travels along pipework and electrical cables, and pools in the lowest accessible cavity. A 2m&sup2; ceiling stain may indicate 10m&sup2; of saturated framing, insulation, and wiring behind the plasterboard. Moisture mapping with thermal imaging frequently reveals 3&ndash;5 times more affected area than visible. Without professional drying within 24&ndash;48 hours, mould colonisation begins in concealed spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Fire and smoke damage</strong> — Visible fire damage is often the smaller cost. Smoke residue (soot, PAHs, VOCs) penetrates every porous surface and is distributed throughout the property via HVAC ducts — not just the room where the fire occurred. Charred structural timber concealed behind wall linings may be weakened. Soft furnishings, carpet underlay, and insulation absorb combustion byproducts requiring specialist cleaning or removal.</li>
          <li><strong>Roof and storm damage</strong> — Roof damage creates progressive water ingress that is not visible for weeks or months. Water enters through damaged tiles, flashing, or sarking, tracks along roof timbers, and saturates insulation. Hail creates hundreds of micro-perforations admitting water during subsequent rain. By the time ceiling staining appears, the roof cavity may have significant mould growth and timber damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Mould</strong> — Visible mould is the tip. Colonies grow on the back side of wall linings, under floor coverings, and inside ceiling cavities where moisture and organic material meet low airflow. A visible mould patch almost always indicates a much larger colony behind the surface. Remediation that addresses only visible growth without investigating concealed areas will fail — the mould returns within weeks.</li>
          <li><strong>Sewage and contaminated water (Category 3)</strong> — Black water contamination from sewage overflow requires complete removal of all porous materials the water contacted — carpet, underlay, plasterboard to 300mm above waterline, insulation, absorbent contents. Contamination zone is always larger than the visible waterline because water wicks upward through porous materials (capillary action) and seeps through joints and gaps.</li>
          <li><strong>Clandestine contamination</strong> — Former drug laboratories (methamphetamine) and undisclosed chemical contamination may only appear during demolition when residue is found on concealed internal surfaces. Scope increases dramatically once invasive investigation begins. Specialist decontamination to safe residue levels is legally required.</li>
          <li><strong>Crime scene and biohazard</strong> — Blood-borne pathogens and biological material penetrate porous surfaces (timber, carpet, concrete) and migrate along joints and gaps. Visual cleanup is insufficient — biological contamination must be verified clear through ATP testing. Sub-floor, wall cavity, and ceiling contamination is common and frequently missed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Building vs Contents — The Split Strategy</h3>
        <p>
          Building insurance covers the structure and fixed fittings (walls, floors, ceilings, plumbing, electrical, built-in cabinetry, ducted air conditioning). Contents insurance covers moveable possessions (furniture, clothing, electronics, portable appliances, artwork). These are separate covers with separate claim pathways. When a disaster damages both, the total claim is split between building and contents components.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you accept a cash settlement for the building portion, those repair costs are settled separately and your contents claim remains fully intact. This matters most when contents damage is extensive — after significant water, fire, or storm events, contents replacement costs frequently approach or exceed the sum insured. Preserving the full contents entitlement by settling building damage separately can be worth tens of thousands of dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Caution:</strong> This strategy is only safe when the building damage is genuinely understood and the cash offer is fair. If there is hidden damage risk, an inadequate building payout becomes your problem after claim closure.
        </p>

        <h3>What a Professional Assessment Includes</h3>
        <p>
          An independent assessment by an IICRC-certified restoration professional includes: visual inspection and documentation of all visible damage; moisture mapping using pin-type and pinless moisture meters across all potentially affected surfaces; thermal imaging to reveal concealed moisture, missing insulation, and thermal bridging; air quality testing where mould or contamination is suspected; a comprehensive scope of works with line-item costings for every remediation and repair task; and full photographic documentation with readings. This is the document you compare against the insurer&apos;s cash offer — and the evidence you use if you need to negotiate or dispute.
        </p>
      </>

    legalSections: (
      <>
        <h3>Insurance Contracts Act 1984</h3>
        <p>
          The ICA 1984 provides the legal framework for all insurance contracts in Australia. Key sections relevant to cash settlements include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Section 54</strong> — Prevents insurers from refusing claims on technical grounds when the policyholder has acted reasonably. This is particularly relevant if you engaged emergency restoration services before the insurer&apos;s assessor arrived — the insurer cannot reduce your claim because you took reasonable steps to mitigate further damage.</li>
          <li><strong>Section 13</strong> — Imposes a duty of utmost good faith on both insurer and insured. The insurer must provide fair and accurate settlement offers. A cash offer calculated using inadequate scope, below-market labour rates, or cheapest-available materials (when your property had premium finishes) may breach this duty.</li>
          <li><strong>Section 57</strong> — Addresses subrogation rights, relevant if you accept a payout and later discover the damage was caused by a third party (e.g., a neighbour&apos;s plumbing, a builder&apos;s defect).</li>
          <li><strong>Section 14</strong> — Requires contracts to be interpreted in a way that gives effect to the reasonable expectations of the insured. If your policy says &ldquo;like-for-like replacement&rdquo;, the settlement should reflect actual like-for-like costs, not the cheapest alternative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>General Insurance Code of Practice</h3>
        <p>
          The Code of Practice is an industry self-regulation framework that all major Australian insurers subscribe to. Relevant obligations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Insurers must handle claims in an honest, fair, transparent, and timely manner</li>
          <li>Insurers must provide reasons for settlement amounts when requested</li>
          <li>Policyholders must be given reasonable time to consider cash settlement offers</li>
          <li>Insurers must not pressure policyholders into accepting settlements before they have had time to obtain independent advice</li>
          <li>Cash settlement offers must be based on fair and reasonable assessment of the loss</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AFCA Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>
          If you believe a cash settlement offer is unfair or does not reflect the true cost of restoration, you have a clear escalation pathway:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Negotiate directly</strong> — Present your independent scope of works and request a revised offer. Show line-item comparisons between the insurer&apos;s scope and yours.</li>
          <li><strong>Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR)</strong> — Lodge a formal complaint through the insurer&apos;s internal complaints process. The insurer must respond within 30 calendar days. Reference specific policy terms, ICA 1984 sections, and your independent documentation.</li>
          <li><strong>AFCA</strong> — If IDR does not resolve the dispute, lodge a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. AFCA provides free, independent dispute resolution for insurance complaints up to $1.085 million. AFCA&apos;s determinations are binding on the insurer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Critical point:</strong> The documentation from a professional assessment — scope of works, moisture mapping data, thermal images, air quality results, photographic evidence — becomes your evidence at every stage of this process. Without it, you are disputing on opinion. With it, you are disputing on evidence.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Right to a Fair Settlement</h3>
        <p>
          Under Australian law, you are entitled to a settlement that reflects the actual cost of restoring your property to its pre-loss condition using like-for-like materials and finishes. An insurer offering a cash settlement based on cheaper materials, lower labour rates than local market rates, or an incomplete scope of works may not be meeting their obligations under the ICA 1984 or the General Insurance Code of Practice. You do not have to accept it.

      { question: 'Can I reopen my claim after accepting a cash settlement?', answer: 'Generally, accepting a cash settlement closes the claim. However, if you discover damage that could not reasonably have been identified at the time of settlement (e.g., concealed water damage behind walls, mould in ceiling cavities, contamination under flooring), you may be able to request the insurer reopen the claim or lodge a complaint with AFCA. This is significantly harder than negotiating before acceptance, which is why we always recommend getting an independent assessment with moisture mapping and thermal imaging before committing to a cash settlement.' },
      { question: 'Should I get an independent assessment before accepting a payout?', answer: 'Yes, always — particularly if the damage involves water, fire, smoke, mould, sewage, or any form of contamination. An independent assessment by an IICRC-certified restoration professional includes moisture mapping, thermal imaging, and potentially invasive investigation that identifies concealed damage a general insurer assessor will miss. The cost of an independent assessment is minimal compared to the risk of accepting an under-scoped payout. This assessment can be the difference between a $15,000 offer and a $40,000–$60,000 actual restoration cost.' },
      { question: 'How do I know if the cash settlement offer is fair?', answer: 'Request the insurer provide a detailed, line-item breakdown of how the cash settlement was calculated — what labour rates, what materials, what scope items are included and excluded. Then get independent quotes from qualified restoration professionals for the full scope of works required. Compare the two documents line by line. If there is a significant gap — particularly if the insurer used below-market rates, builder\'s-grade materials replacing premium finishes, or excluded concealed damage areas — the offer may not be fair under the General Insurance Code of Practice.' },
      { question: 'What is the contents claims strategy and when should I use it?', answer: 'Your building and contents insurance are separate covers with separate claim pathways. If contents damage is significant (a typical family home has $80,000–$150,000 in contents), taking a cash settlement for the building repair means building costs are settled separately and your full contents entitlement is preserved. This is most valuable when contents loss is close to or exceeds the sum insured. However, it only works safely when the building damage is genuinely understood — if hidden building damage appears after you accept the building payout, those costs are yours.' },
      { question: 'What types of damage are most commonly under-assessed?', answer: 'Water damage, fire and smoke damage, roof/storm damage, mould, sewage contamination, clandestine contamination, and crime scene/biohazard damage are all consistently under-assessed at first inspection. These damage types share a common characteristic: the concealed damage is significantly greater than what is visible. Water wicks behind walls, smoke distributes through HVAC systems, mould grows on the back of surfaces, sewage contaminates sub-floor structures. An insurer assessor performing a visual-only inspection will miss all of this.' },
      { question: 'Can I negotiate a higher cash settlement?', answer: 'Yes. Cash settlement offers are negotiable. Present the insurer with your independent scope of works, line-item costings from qualified professionals, moisture mapping data, thermal images, and any air quality test results. Show the specific gap between their scope and the actual scope. Many insurers increase the offer when presented with documented evidence. If they refuse, escalate through Internal Dispute Resolution (30-day response requirement) and then to AFCA if necessary.' },
      { question: 'How long do I have to decide on a cash settlement offer?', answer: 'There is no legislated deadline, but insurers may propose a response timeframe. You are entitled to reasonable time to consider the offer and obtain independent advice. Under the General Insurance Code of Practice, insurers must not pressure policyholders into hasty decisions. If you feel rushed, request an extension in writing and document the request. Take the time to get a professional assessment — a few days of delay is far less costly than accepting an inadequate settlement.' },
      { question: 'What if I accept a payout and the repair costs more than expected?', answer: 'If you accepted the settlement and the claim is closed, costs above the settlement amount are generally your responsibility. This is the primary risk of accepting a cash settlement without a thorough independent assessment. If the additional costs are due to damage that could not reasonably have been identified at settlement (truly concealed damage), you may have grounds to request the claim be reopened or to lodge an AFCA complaint — but this is difficult and not guaranteed. Prevention (independent assessment before acceptance) is always better than remedy.' },
