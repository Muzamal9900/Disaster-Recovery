            While waiting for our emergency team, these steps can help protect you and minimise
            further damage to your property:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Ensure personal safety first</strong> — Evacuate if there is any risk from fire, structural damage, electrical hazards, or contaminated water. Do not re-enter until cleared.</li>
            <li><strong>Turn off utilities if safe to do so</strong> — For water damage, shut off the mains water supply. For electrical hazards, switch off at the main breaker if accessible without risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Document the damage</strong> — Take photos and video of all visible damage before touching anything. This is critical for your insurance claim.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove valuables from harm</strong> — If safe, move important documents, electronics, and irreplaceable items away from the affected area.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not attempt DIY cleanup of contaminated areas</strong> — Sewage, biohazard, asbestos, and smoke damage require professional protocols. Improper handling creates health risks.</li>

            We believe emergencies should not cost you more simply because of when they happen.
            Our {emergencyType.toLowerCase()} services carry the same rates as standard business
            hours, with no surcharges, no penalty rates, and no hidden fees.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>No call-out fee</strong> — The initial emergency assessment is free.</li>
            <li><strong>No after-hours surcharge</strong> — Same rates 24/7, 365 days a year.</li>
            <li><strong>No weekend or public holiday penalties</strong> — Disasters do not take holidays, and neither do our pricing commitments.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance direct billing</strong> — For insured events, we bill your insurer directly. You pay only your policy excess.</li>

          <h3>Is there really no extra charge for {emergencyType.toLowerCase()} callouts?</h3>
          <p>
            Correct. We do not charge call-out fees, after-hours rates, or public holiday surcharges.
            The same competitive rates apply 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
          </p>
          <h3>How fast can you respond?</h3>
          <p>
            Our target response time is 60 minutes or less to any metropolitan area in Australia.
            Regional and remote areas may take longer depending on distance, but we always dispatch
            the nearest available contractor immediately.
          </p>
          <h3>Should I call my insurer first or call you?</h3>
          <p>
            Call us first. Stopping the damage is the priority. We will contact your insurer on your
            behalf during the initial assessment. Delays in emergency response can significantly
            increase total damage and claim costs.
          </p>
          <h3>What emergencies do you respond to?</h3>
          <p>
            We respond to all property emergencies including water damage, fire and smoke damage,
            storm damage, flood events, sewage overflows, mould emergencies, biohazard situations,
            and structural damage requiring emergency stabilisation.
