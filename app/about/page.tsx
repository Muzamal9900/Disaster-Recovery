              <p>
                Disaster Recovery Australia is a national claims distribution platform that connects property owners, tenants, and businesses with IICRC-certified restoration contractors across every state and territory. We operate as the bridge between insurance claims and qualified professionals — ensuring the right contractor reaches every job, anywhere in Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our platform operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. There are no phone queues, no business-hours limitations, and no geographic restrictions. Whether it&apos;s a burst pipe in a Sydney CBD high-rise at 2am or cyclone damage to a remote Queensland property on Christmas Day, our system matches the job to the nearest qualified contractor automatically.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are not a restoration company — we are the distribution network that makes restoration happen faster, more transparently, and with transparent billing, flexible payment options, and full insurance claims documentation.

              <p>
                Property disasters don&apos;t follow business hours. Our mission is to ensure that every Australian — regardless of location, time of day, or type of disaster — can access certified restoration professionals within hours, not days.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe in complete transparency: no hidden fees, no unnecessary delays, and no intermediaries between the property owner and the contractor doing the work. Every contractor in our network bills you directly — so work begins immediately without insurer delays. We provide all documentation you need to claim reimbursement from your insurer.
              </p>
              <p>
                We bill you directly; we provide the services you&apos;re entitled to — the insurance policy holders pay in accordance with your policy. We follow Australian laws, recommendations, and best practices, and all our qualified and certified business owners do too. It is a network you can trust, but we also need to be paid.

              <p>
                Our operational model is designed for ruthless cost efficiency — not to maximise shareholder returns, but to ensure the largest possible portion of revenue flows back into community disaster resilience, contractor training, and emergency preparedness programmes across Australia.
