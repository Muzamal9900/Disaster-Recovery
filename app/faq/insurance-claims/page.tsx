    "question": "How does billing and payment work?",
    "answer": "Our contractors bill you (the property owner) directly, which means work can begin immediately without waiting for insurer approval. Once work is complete, we provide all documentation — scope of works, photos, reports — that your insurer needs to process your reimbursement claim. Flexible payment plans are available through our finance partner, <a href=\"https://www.bluefirefinance.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blue Fire Finance</a>."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if my claim is denied?",
    "answer": "We can help appeal denials by providing additional documentation, expert reports, and clarification. Many initial denials are overturned with proper supporting evidence."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need multiple quotes for insurance?",
    "answer": "Most insurers accept our contractors' quotes immediately due to their certification and reputation. Our online system provides multiple quotes automatically for comparison."
  },
  {
    "question": "What documentation do I need?",
    "answer": "Keep your policy number, claim number, photos of damage, and any correspondence. Our contractors handle technical documentation, moisture readings, and restoration reports."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long do insurance claims take?",
    "answer": "Emergency mitigation starts immediately. Initial approval usually within 24-48 hours. Full claim settlement varies from 1-4 weeks depending on damage extent and insurer."
