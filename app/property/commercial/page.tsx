  const faqs = [
    {
      question: 'How quickly should a commercial property respond to disaster damage?',
      answer: 'Commercial properties need immediate response within 1-2 hours for emergency mitigation. Every hour of delay can mean thousands in additional damage and extended business interruption. Have an emergency response plan and pre-selected restoration contractor for fastest response.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the difference between property damage and business interruption insurance?',
      answer: 'Property insurance covers physical damage to buildings, equipment, and inventory. Business interruption insurance covers lost income and ongoing expenses during closure. Both are essential - property insurance alone won\'t cover the revenue lost while repairs are underway.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can businesses minimize downtime during restoration?',
      answer: 'Key strategies include: having a business continuity plan, setting up temporary operations, using phased restoration to reopen partially, expediting critical area repairs, and maintaining clear communication with customers about reopening timelines.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What documentation is needed for commercial insurance claims?',
      answer: 'Document everything: photos/videos of damage, inventory lists with values, financial records showing normal revenue, expense records during closure, restoration receipts, and communication logs. The more thorough your documentation, the smoother your claim process.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should businesses use preferred vendor programs from insurers?',
      answer: 'Preferred vendors can expedite claims and often guarantee their work to the insurer. However, you typically have the right to choose your own contractor. Compare options and ensure any contractor is properly licensed, insured, and experienced with commercial restoration.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do you calculate business interruption losses?',
      answer: 'Calculate based on historical financial data: average daily/weekly revenue from the same period in previous years, accounting for growth trends and seasonality. Include fixed costs that continue during closure. Work with your accountant to properly document losses.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What about employee wages during disaster closure?',
      answer: 'This depends on your policies and insurance coverage. Some business interruption policies cover ordinary payroll. Consider the impact on employee retention and morale. Many businesses pay key employees to help with recovery efforts.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can businesses prepare for future disasters?',
      answer: 'Develop and regularly update a disaster response plan, maintain adequate insurance coverage, keep off-site backups of critical data and documents, establish relationships with restoration contractors, and conduct regular emergency drills with staff.'
