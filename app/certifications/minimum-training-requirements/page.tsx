              <p>
                <strong>Why this is mandatory:</strong> Asbestos was used extensively in Australian building materials until the late 1980s. Any property built before 1990 may contain asbestos in wall sheeting, insulation, flooring, roofing, and pipe lagging. Disturbing asbestos-containing materials without proper training is illegal under the{' '}
                <em>Work Health and Safety Act 2011</em> and can cause fatal diseases including mesothelioma and asbestosis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Disaster recovery work — particularly water damage, fire damage, and demolition — frequently involves disturbing building materials. Every technician must be able to identify potential asbestos-containing materials and follow correct procedures before any invasive work begins.

              <p>
                These training requirements are not optional guidelines — they are mandatory prerequisites enforced across our entire network. Here is why:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
                <li>
                  <strong>Australian WHS legislation compliance</strong> — The <em>Work Health and Safety Act 2011</em> and corresponding state regulations require all workers to be trained in workplace safety relevant to their duties. Non-compliance exposes both the contractor and the property owner to legal liability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Duty of care to property owners and workers</strong> — Restoration sites involve contaminated water, hazardous chemicals, structural instability, electrical risks, and biological hazards. Untrained workers on these sites endanger themselves, occupants, and neighbouring properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Insurance requirements for certified work</strong> — Major insurers require restoration to be performed by appropriately trained and certified professionals. Work performed by untrained contractors may void the property owner&apos;s claim or result in disputes during the claims process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>IICRC and industry standards alignment</strong> — The IICRC restoration standards (S500, S520, S540) reference OH&S competency as a prerequisite for all restoration work. These training courses ensure our technicians meet the baseline safety knowledge required by international restoration standards.
