# 🚀 Production Setup Guide - Disaster Recovery Australia

## 📋 Overview

This platform operates in two modes:
1. **Demo Mode** (Default) - Uses mock data and services, perfect for investor presentations
2. **Production Mode** - Live services activated when API keys are configured

## 🎭 Current Status: DEMO MODE

The system is currently running in Demo Mode with:
- ✅ Full functionality with mock data
- ✅ 50 mock contractors across Australia
- ✅ 200 sample leads over 3 months
- ✅ Simulated payments, AI responses, and notifications
- ✅ Complete investor demo scenarios

## 🔑 Switching to Production

### Step 1: Obtain API Keys

You'll need to obtain the following API keys:

#### 1. **Stripe** (Payment Processing)
- Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com
- Get your keys from Developers → API Keys
- Required keys:
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (starts with `sk_live_` for production)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (starts with `pk_live_` for production)
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (from Webhooks section)

#### 2. **OpenRouter** (AI Orchestration)
- Sign up at https://openrouter.ai
- Get your API key from Account Settings
- Required: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

#### 3. **Anthropic** (Claude AI)
- Sign up at https://console.anthropic.com
- Get your API key from API Keys section
- Required: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

#### 4. **Email Service** (SMTP)
- Use any SMTP service (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, etc.)
- Required configuration:
  - `EMAIL_SERVER_HOST`
  - `EMAIL_SERVER_PORT`
  - `EMAIL_SERVER_USER`
  - `EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD`
  - `EMAIL_FROM`

#### 5. **Optional Services**
- **Twilio** (SMS): `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
- **Google Maps**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- **Clean Claims (CARSI)**: Contact provider for integration
- **PISA Background Checks**: Contact provider for API access

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

#### For Local Development:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your API keys:

```bash
# .env.local
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/disaster_recovery"

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# AI Services
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your_key_here

# Email
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=apikey
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your_sendgrid_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@disasterrecovery.com.au

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate_with_openssl_rand_base64_32
```

#### For Production (Vercel):
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add each variable for the Production environment
4. **IMPORTANT**: Never commit actual API keys to Git

### Step 3: Database Setup

#### For Development:
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL locally
# Create database
createdb disaster_recovery

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev
```

#### For Production:
1. Use a managed PostgreSQL service:
   - **Recommended**: Neon, Supabase, or AWS RDS
   - Get your connection string
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel

2. Run production migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# The system will automatically detect API keys and switch to production mode
```

## 🔍 Verifying Production Mode

When properly configured, you'll see:
1. Demo Mode banner will disappear
2. Console will show: "✅ Production Mode Active"
3. Real payments will process through Stripe
4. AI responses will use OpenRouter/Anthropic
5. Emails will send via SMTP
6. All mock services will be replaced with live integrations

## 📊 Production Checklist

## 💡 Quick Troubleshooting

### System stays in Demo Mode:
- Check all required API keys are set
- Verify keys are in Production environment (not just Development)
- Check for typos in environment variable names
- Restart the application after adding keys

### Payments not processing:
- Verify Stripe webhook endpoint is configured
- Check Stripe API key starts with `sk_live_` (not `sk_test_`)
- Ensure webhook secret is correct

### Emails not sending:
- Verify SMTP credentials
- Check firewall allows outbound SMTP
- Test with a tool like `swaks` or `telnet`

**Remember**: The system is designed to fail gracefully. If any service is unavailable, it will fall back to mock mode for that specific service while keeping others operational.
